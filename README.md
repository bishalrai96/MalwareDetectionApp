# MalwareDetectionApp

Malware Detection App for University Dissertation. This app uses machine learning algorithm to detect malicious software on the devices.
The App is trained on the PC and is deployed on the user device, which uses static analysis to pattern match with the data that
model was trained with.
Currently the model only performs permission based analysis. 


**Update:**
App is deployed on user's device which will be used to communicate with model sitting behind the webserver.

**Future Work:**
Include API calls
Include multiple algorithm in single model
Target specific app genre
Collect more data to train our model
